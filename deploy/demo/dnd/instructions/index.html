				<h1>Developer Assignment</h1>
				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<p>Create a basic photo ordering tool based on the images and JavaScript include provided. Thumbnails of the images should display in the order dictated by the include using a grid-based layout, and should be re-orderable by dragging the images to their desired position.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This should be a completely client-side exercise. Server code to store the new photo order isn’t necessary.</li>
					<li>While the use of libraries is permitted for basic DOM manipulation or event handling, it’s expected that the core JavaScript should be your original work.</li>
					<li>Code should be optimized for Safari. Support for other browsers is not necessary.</li>
					<li>As a general rule, the assignment should take 2-3 hours.</li>
					<li>Extra points for style.</li>
				</ul>
